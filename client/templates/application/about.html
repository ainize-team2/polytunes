            Hundreds of open-source projects or hackathon winning ideas with great potential 
            end up being forgotten in Github repositories. We found Polytunes, 
            a global hackathon-winning project that was awarded with the People’s Choice Award. 
            This collaborative music game is to create melodies and amuse people. 
            Powered by Ainize, we published the next version of Polytunes with new features -- 
            but there’s still plenty of room for improvement.

          <h4>
            Polytunes is an interactive music pad that aims at creating a new kind of melodies by 
            collaborating without speaking to other players. The project was initially developed 
            by Clement Bourgoin, submitted to the 2015 Meteor global Distributed Hackathon. 
            Polytunes makes music only using a Javascript library called Wad, a wrapper around 
            HTML5 WebAudio API, without utilizing flash or sound files.
