            Hundreds of open-source projects or hackathon winning ideas with
            great potential end up being forgotten in Github repositories. We
            found Crowdy, a hackathon-winning project that has great potential
            to help people globally. Powered by Ainize, we published the next
            version of Crowdy with new features -- but there’s still plenty of
            room for improvement.

          <h4>
            Crowdy displays the LIVE status of nearby supermarkets, hospitals,
            pharmacies, banks, and restaurants based on your current location to
            help people avoid crowded places, minimizing COVID19 risks. The
            project was initially developed by Andrew Lim, submitted to COVID-19
            Global Hackathon 1.0.
