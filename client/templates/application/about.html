          <h2>What is Polytunes</h2>
          <p>
            Polytunes is an interactive music pad that aims at creating a new kind of melodies by 
            collaborating without speaking to other players. The project was initially developed 
            by Clement Bourgoin and was submitted to the 2015 Meteor global Distributed Hackathon.<br/><br/>
            Polytunes makes music only using a Javascript library called Wad, a wrapper around 
            HTML5 WebAudio API, without utilizing flash or sound files.<br/><br/>
