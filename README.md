# Polytunes

Polytunes is a music pad built using Meteor and HTML5's WebAudio API under 24h during the [2015 Meteor Global Distributed Hackathon](http://meteor-2015.devpost.com/).

## Idea

Polytunes is inspired by Yamaha's Tenori-on. The idea was to build a sequencer synthetizer using only HTML5 (no Flash or sound files) and make it online and multiplayer using Meteor. Multiple players can join and update the melody on-the-go. All changes are instantly pushed to all other players.
